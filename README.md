# SpleefChess

Short description of the project: This project is about a chess game where both players can only use the knight piece, and with every legal move they take, the previous cell they were standing on becomes unusable for the rest of the match. The name of the project comes from a once popular minigame from the game Minecraft, as it bares great resemblance to this version of Chess.

"Spleef is a competitive minigame played within Minecraft. When playing spleef, players destroy blocks below other players, allowing them to fall off the playing field and into a pit. The object of the game is to be the last player on the field. The name is a portmanteau of splat, referring to the sound of players hitting the ground below, and grief, as the game involves destroying blocks.
